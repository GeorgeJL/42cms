All the .php files in folder plugins (and all subfolders) can be called as plugin e.g. file "includes/plugins/members/logout.php" is called "[(members/logout)]" -without "includes/plugins/" and ".php"

To create plugin, simply place your .php file into folder "includes/plugins". For your plugin might be very usefull these variables: "$config" containing configuration of the script and "$pluginVars" some other plugin specific data

Plugin is entered into page text by replacing its placeholder (e.g. [(menu)]) with content of variable "$return"
